# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
 1.Import Necessary Libraries:
Import NumPy, pandas, and StandardScaler for numerical operations, data handling, and feature scaling, respectively.

2.Define the Linear Regression Function:
Create a linear regression function using gradient descent to iteratively update parameters, minimizing the difference between predicted and actual values.

3.Load and Preprocess the Data:
Load the dataset, extract features and target variable, and standardize both using StandardScaler for consistent model training.

4.Perform Linear Regression:
Apply the defined linear regression function to the scaled features and target variable, obtaining optimal parameters for the model.

5.Make Predictions on New Data:
Prepare new data, scale it, and use the trained model to predict the target variable, transforming predictions back to the original scale.

 6.Print the Predicted Value
